# Memory-Game

* The memory game is a simple game where players must click on all the images, without clicking on the same image twice.

* There are two files, "images.json" and "images-easy.json", that contain the information to render the images. The regular version of the game contains 25 images, while the easy version contains 5. Change the ".json" line (import images from "./images.json") in "App.js" to switch between the games.
